# Tarot Encyclopedia

The Tarot Encyclopedia is an application that will assist in tarot readings. You will be able to search through and reference various cards and meanings through the form that will pull together a three card spread. 

You can navigate this application by using the links at the top of the screen. No matter where you scroll the links will follow along. 

The 'Home' feature of this application displays information about what Tarot is and how to do an actual reading. This also has a form for you to inputy our own tarot spreads.

'All Tarot Cards' will allow the user to search through each tarot card, it's description, and meaning. Similarly the 'Spreads' link will allow the user to search through the spreads a user inputs. One key feature of the spreads component is that it has a delete for users to remove an entry that they would like to take away.

Lastly, the 'About' component, which is a part of the 'Home' component displays, but this explicitly references how to do tarot and reads spreads.
